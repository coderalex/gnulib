I present a patch to allow parse-datetime to -- finally -- accept
dates in the ISO 8601 basic format. This is a format allowing the
expression of an absolute point in time with the resolution of a
second with only alphanumeric characters -- no spaces, no punctuation,
suitable for use in fields that cannot contain spaces, hyphens, or
colons. As with the full format, the UTC time zone may be specified
with a "Z". Other time offsets will require a hyphen or a plus
sign, and fractions of time units may be expressed with the addition
of a dot or comma.

The general format is string of digits representing the date, followed
by the letter "T" followed by a string of digits representing the time,
optionally followed by a zone offset.

This will allow datetime strings of the following formats:

YYYYMMDDThhmm, e.g. 20190121T0304, 20180102T0304Z, 20180102T1104-0800
YYYYMMDDThhmmss, e.g. 20190102T030405

Decimal parts of seconds as well as minutes and hours are accepted
(dot or comma may be used):

20180102T210729.068302473 = 2018-01-02T21:07:29,068302473
19800615T1230.5 = 1980-06-15T12:30:30
19660620T6,666666666 = 1966-06-20T06:40:00

Two-digit year specifiers are also accepted following existing
parse-datetime rules, so:

180102T0304   = 2018-01-02T03:04
991231T2300   = 1999-12-31T23:00
190120T030405 = 2019-01-20T03:04:05 


Notes:

In general accordance with the ISO 8601 standard, the number of
digits to the left of the "T" determines how they are interpreted:

9 = YYYYYMMDD
8 =  YYYYMMDD
7 =   YYYMMDD ?
6 =    YYMMDD *
5 =     YMMDD ?
4 =      YYYY
3 =       YYY ? 
2 =        CC
1 =         C ?

* no longer supported by ISO 8601
? not specified by ISO 8601

For best compatibility, the number of digits to the left of "T"
should be at least 8 (with leading zeroes for years before 1000 and
additional digits for years after 9999).

However, truncated 6-digit version is allowed, to be interpreted
as YYMMDD with an implied century part determined by existing
parse-datetime behavior of prefixing "19" to YY in range 69-99 and
"20" to the rest. This interpretation is allowed in the second
edition of ISO 8601 (published in 2000), but it was removed in the
third (2004) edition.

Also, ISO 8601 specifies that a four-digit date string is to be
interpreted as a year, and a two-digit date string is to be interpreted
as a century, to be multiplied by 100 to yield the year. Accordinlgy,
a date string that imply no month or day (4 or fewer digits) is
interpreted as the first day of the first month of the year indicated.

YYYYThh e.g., 2018T03 = 3AM on the first day of 2018

CCThhmmss, e.g. 20T000001 = one second into century "20" (year 2000).
