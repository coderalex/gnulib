I present a patch to allow parse-datetime to -- finally -- accept
dates in the ISO 8601 basic format.  that is, a time string consisting
of only alphanumeric characters -- no spaces, no punctuation, suitable
for use in fields that cannot contain spaces, hyphens, or colons.

This will allow datetime strings of the following formats, all
followed optionally by a zone offset:

YYYYMMDDThhmm, e.g. 20180102T0304, 20180102T0304Z, 20180102T1104-0800
YYYYMMDDThhmmss, e.g. 20180102T030405

YYMMDDThhmm, e.g. 180102T0304 YYMMDDThhmmss, e.g. 180102T030405

as well as:

YYYYThh, e.g., 2018T03 = 3AM on first day of 2018

CCThh, e.g. 20T000001 = second minute of 21st century

In addition, decimal parts of seconds are accepted (dot or comma
may be used):

20180102T210729.068302473
