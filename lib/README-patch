I present a patch to allow parse-datetime to -- finally -- accept
dates in the ISO 8601 basic format. This is a format allowing the
expression of an absolute point in time with the resolution of a
second with only alphanumeric characters -- no spaces, no punctuation,
suitable for use in fields that cannot contain spaces, hyphens, or
colons. As with the full format, the UTC time zone may be specified
with a "Z". Other time offsets will require a hyphen or a plus
sign, and fractions of time units including those other than seconds
may be expressed with the addition of a dot or comma. The ability
to express fractions of a minute as a decimal is also made available
to the extended format.


The general format is string of digits representing the date, followed
by the letter "T" followed by a string of digits representing the time,
optionally followed by a zone offset.

This will allow datetime strings of the following formats:

YYYYMMDDThhmm, e.g. 20190121T0304, 20180102T0304Z, 20180102T1104-0800
YYYYMMDDThhmmss, e.g. 20190102T030405

Decimal parts of seconds as well as minutes and hours are accepted
(dot or comma may be used):

20180102T210729.068302473             = 2018-01-02T21:07:29,068302473
19800615T1230.25, 1980-06-15T12:30.25 = 1980-06-15T12:30:15
19800615T12.25                        = 1980-06-15T12:15:00
19660620T06,666666666                 = 1966-06-20T06:40:00

Two-digit year specifiers are also accepted following existing
parse-datetime rules (69-99 = 1969-1999, 00-68 = 2000-2068), so:

180102T0304   = 2018-01-02T03:04
991231T2300   = 1999-12-31T23:00
190120T030405 = 2019-01-20T03:04:05 

Note use of two-digit year specifiers in both basic and extended formats
is allowed in the second edition of ISO 8601 (published in 2000), but it
has been removed as of the third (2004) edition.
